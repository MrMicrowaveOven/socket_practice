Just me practicing Web Socket to make a basic chat application.

Give it a go by opening index.js in node (command below).  It'll begin the server and will be listening for you to connect via your browser (type localhost:3000 into your browser).  Everytime a tab connects to the localhost, it'll keep a count and let you know on the console.  The messages in the browser were to see if there were enough people (2) for a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

It was VERY easy to do, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to learn WebSocket.

Type this in the console to get started:

`node index.js`
